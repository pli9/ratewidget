# ratewidget

A `ratewidget` displays a single statistic derived from a linked table, where the numerator and denominator columns are specific. This is best used with the `crosstalk` package, to allow dynamic filtering of the underlying data.

An example of a `ratewidget` is available on this page: <https://pli9.github.io/ratewidget/>
